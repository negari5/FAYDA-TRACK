## 📘 Project Overview

### 🔍 Problem
Most Ethiopians lack digital health records, especially those who:
- Receive informal care or community-based treatment
- Lose or never receive formal documentation (e.g., checkups, maternal health, chronic illness tracking)
- Cannot prove their health history for jobs, school, travel, or support

This leads to **gaps in care**, **denied opportunities**, and **data loss**.

---

### 💡 Solution

**FAYDA-HEALTHTRACK** is a secure platform to:
- Log informal health episodes (e.g., volunteer clinics, traditional care)
- Upload supporting evidence (e.g., prescriptions, testimonials)
- Track chronic conditions and wellness goals
- Allow third-party verification by NGOs or clinics
- Generate verified health summaries
- All linked to the citizen's Fayda Digital ID

### 🧠 What Makes It Stand Out?

**Fayda-integrated OIDC login** + **verified self-reported care**  
→ Users own their records  
→ Institutions trust their history  
→ Health journeys become visible, portable, and verifiable
