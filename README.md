## üìò Overview
FAYDA-HEALTHTRACK is an innovative digital platform enabling Ethiopian citizens to securely log, track, and verify their personal and informal health histories. This includes everyday health events, community-based care, fitness routines, chronic illness monitoring, and verified vaccination or test records ‚Äî all safeguarded through the Fayda biometric ID system.

The platform empowers users to take ownership of their health journeys while providing authorized care providers, NGOs, and institutions with real-time, secure access to verified health records.

## üîç Problem Statement
In Ethiopia, the health documentation landscape faces significant challenges:

Most health care, especially in rural or underserved areas, is informal or community-based, lacking formal records.

Health records are often paper-based, fragile, and easily lost or damaged.

There is no unified system to validate or prove fitness, vaccination status, or chronic illness history.

Informal health-related activities like personal wellness logs, maternal care checkups, or fitness tracking lack trusted verification.

These challenges cause care gaps, delays in service delivery, and hinder access to insurance, employment, scholarships, or travel opportunities requiring verified health documentation.

## üí° Our Solution
FAYDA-HEALTHTRACK addresses these issues by offering a simple, secure, and inclusive digital health record platform that allows users to:

Authenticate securely using Fayda Digital ID biometric verification.

Record informal health activities such as community care episodes, wellness logs, or maternal health checkups.

Track chronic conditions, medications, and routine checkups for continuous health monitoring.

Upload health evidence ‚Äî including clinic cards, medical reports, photos, or vaccination certificates.

Enable verification by authorized NGOs, community health workers, or clinics for credible health data validation.

Generate verified health summaries for use in schools, employment, travel, or insurance applications.

Share health data securely through QR codes or permission-based links, ensuring user privacy and control.

Leverage AI insights to detect health patterns, recommend prevention tips, and highlight missing or critical health records.

## üéØ Target Users
